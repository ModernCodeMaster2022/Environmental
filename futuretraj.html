        <h1><strong> The Past Trajectory of the Environment </strong></h1>
    <br>
    <br>
        <p>Have you ever stopped to think about how the environment was 
           during the origins of the Earth in comparison to how it is today? 
           It has indeed changed to a great extent. The Earth has continued its cycle for several years, 
        however, after several humans and species began to diversify on this planet, experts say Carbon Dioxide levels have increased
    to a great extent and will continue to do so in the near future. This comes from 
fossil fuel emissions, reduction of natural resources, and more demand than supply.</p>

        <h1><strong> The Future Trajectory of the Environment </strong></h1>
    <br>
        <p> The trajectory of the evironment right now is currently headed to 
            warmer atmospheres, a warmer and more acidic ocean, higher sea levels
            due to ice melting at a faster rate, larger changes in percipitation 
            patterns, the shirking of ice sheets and ice caps at a faster rate, 
            and more intense and frequent heat waves.</p>

        <h1><strong> Solutions to Climate Change </strong></h1>
    <br>
        <p> Some solutions include lowering the usage of energy in your home, replace methods of transportation 
            that emit greehouse gases, such as cars, buses and motorcycles, with transportation methods such as walking and
            bicycling, cut down on less red meat consumption, litter less, recycle, reuse and repair more and maybe consider switching to 
            an electric vehicle.</p>
